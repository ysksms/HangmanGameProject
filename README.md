# Hangman Game Project

## Project Description
This is a text-based Hangman game implemented in Python. The player tries to guess a randomly chosen word by suggesting letters. The game provides feedback on the number of incorrect guesses remaining and displays the current state of the word being guessed.

## Project Files
- `hangman.py`: The main Python script for the game.
- `words.txt`: A text file containing a list of words for the game.
- `functions.py`: A Python module containing functions that manage the game logic and flow.

## How to Run the Game
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. Make sure you are currently in the MiniProject_Python directory.
4. Run the game using the command:
    `python hangman.py`
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to play.

## How to Play
- The player guesses letters one at a time.
- The game displays the current state of the word, with underscores for unguessed letters.
- The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses (default is 6).
- The game ends when the player guesses the word or runs out of incorrect guesses.
